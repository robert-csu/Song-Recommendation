# PA6 - Cluster proximity playlist

## Motivation

In PA5, you implemented K-means clustering to group similar songs based on normalized user ratings (after filling in missing ratings and then re-normalizing). Now, we'll use these clusters to generate personalized recommendations for new users of your streaming platform! When a user tells us they like specific songs, we can quickly find other songs they might enjoy by leveraging song proximity within clusters. The goal is to make a playlist of up to 20 songs that our user might like.

_Notice: This assignment has shorter instructions than usual, which can be a common scenario in real-world software development. While the assignment is a quite simple extension of PA5, your challenge is to come up with your own implementation tasks to generate the corresponding output as seen in the input/output examples._

## Input Format

Your program must accept 5 or more command-line arguments, with K being the number of user-provided songs as initial centroids. 

`gradle run -q --args="'<input_file>' '<output_file>' '-s' 'K' '<liked_song_name1>' '<liked_song_name2>' ..."`

This means for our clustering process, the initialization uses the first `K` user-provided songs as initial centroids. The rest of the clustering process is the same as in PA5 (10 iterations, Euclidean distance).

## Playlist Generation
After clustering, find the (up to) 20 songs that are closest to all our user-provided songs (not the `K` first user-provided songs). Follow the provided pseudo-code algorithm. This algorithm represents the idea of the program conceptually, but depending on your previous code structure you may have to change the details of some steps entirely.


```
# For ALL user-provided songs (including those beyond first K)
For each user_liked_song s in user_provided_songs:
	For each song t in the same cluster as s:
	    If (t != s)
			Let d = 1.0 / euclidean_distance(t, s)
			Keep best (max) d for each candidate song
Create list of all candidate songs (excluding user-provided songs) with their best distances
Sort list by d, write the (up to) top 20 songs to output file 
```

## Error Handling

- All errors from PA5 still apply
- If argument -p is present for playlist generation throw an error in these cases:
	- Fewer than 5 arguments present
	- K < 1
	- Fewer user-provided songs than K
	- User-provided song not found
	- Duplicate song titles in input
	- Pre-processing leaves fewer than K+1 songs

# Example Input/Output

Note: All features from previous PAs are still expected to work.
